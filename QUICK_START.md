# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

Get the WhatsApp Clone with push notifications running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)

- Expo Go app (for testing)

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd WhatsAppClone
npm install
```

## Step 2: Start the App

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the Expo development server. You'll see a QR code.

## Step 3: Run on Device

### Option A: Using Expo Go (Easiest)
1. Install Expo Go from Google Play Store
2. Scan the QR code with Expo Go
3. The app will load on your device

### Option B: Using Android Studio
1. Press 'a' in the terminal to open Android emulator
2. Or connect your Android device via USB

## Step 4: Test Notifications

Once the app is running:

1. **Grant notification permissions** when prompted
2. **Tap "Test Call Notification"** to see a call notification
3. **Tap "Test Chat Notification"** to see a message notification
4. **Navigate to Notifications screen** to see notification history

## Step 5: Test Backend (Optional)

To test with the backend simulation:

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
npm install express firebase-admin cors axios

# Start backend server
node backend-simulation.js

# In another terminal, run tests
node test-notifications.js
```
